      <p>
        In this project, I worked to map the time I spent alone. I recorded the moments I was alone, whether I was alone by myself or alone in a group of people (sometimes you can be alone in a crowded room), and finally, how I felt while I was alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data portrait can be read at the bottom of the p5.js sketch. Each point represents a moment that I was alone. From there, you can see whether I was inside or outside, and the specific emotion associated with that moment alone (either angry, confused, pensive, calm, or lonely).
      </p>

        src="assets/img-dataPortrait-drawing.jpeg"

        />
      </div>

      <p>
        In my design process, I tried to focus on simple representations of the data. I focused on using simple shapes, color, and a key to communicate that point. I did struggle to represent the data digitally using the tools I had, but this exercise allowed me to identify areas that I needed to work on within my code. I definitely lost some of the details that I wanted to include (such as the representation of whether there were people around while I was alone).
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, it was an interesting exercise, and I enjoyed engaging with the complexity of aloneness through this lens.
