      <p>
        In this project, we had to select a pattern from our cultural history,
        and bring it to life through code. By coding this into a pattern and
        making it interactive, it can create an optical illusion (Critical
        Computation 2021).
      </p>

          src="https://cdn.glitch.me/c5129550-5815-48a4-a8a6-b37d3c069ff5%2FIMG_0131.jpg?v=1633453552033"

        I chose to represent and modify a Chinese tapestry that my grandmother
        owns and holds very dear to her. The tapestry has been passed down for
        generations, although through this project, I realized that I didn't
        know the full backstory of the piece.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tapestry has 5 embroidered dragons (a lucky number!), each holding a
        fiery pearl. Based on the style of the dragon embroidery, the tapestry
        looks to be a relic of the Qing dynasty (1636-1912).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the complexity of the dragon embroidery, I imported an
        excerpt from the tapestry. That enabled me to play with the image and
        create patterns from that, instead of spending an exorbitant amount of
        time sketching each curving, winding shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        I liked how the noise() element looked like turbulence or like the bumps you feel while on a ship. They made me think of the journey my grandmother and great-grandmother took in order to get to the US, and all of the emotions they must have been feeling.

      <p>
        I enjoyed learning more about my family history through the act of making. I benefit from the incorporation of extremely personal themes. It forces me to be deliberate about the narrative of my work, and adds to the final piece.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the weeks continue, I would like to work on my faculty over for loops and more complex statements in JavaScript. There is a lot more to learn, which would have done this sketch and my grandmother's tapestry even more justice.
