      <p>
        Exquisite corpse is a surrealist exercise that helps varying conceptions
        of body parts come together. We exchanged drawings with our peers in the
        Critical Computation Lab in order to create beautiful monsters (Critical
        Computation 2021).
      </p>

      <p>
        This composite drawing was taken directly from the drawings of Hasan
        Khalid, Cissie Wang, and Zeshan (MFA Design and Technology students,
        class of '23). Their original drawings are included below.

        This project was a fascinating venue for communicating emotion through
        time. I used this sketch as a reflection upon time and grief in the
        global COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, time was rendered so
        differently from the way we had known it previously; days blurred
        together, hours bled into one another, and weeks slowed and sped by with
        no real pattern. 2020 was the year that conventional, standardized time
        was exposed as the arbitrary, self-imposed regulator, and I wanted to
        capture that in this sketch.
      </p>

      <p>
        I randomized the shades of grey in the monitor screen to make the screen
        look more naturalistic, like it was giving off flickering light.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my eyes, this creature is waiting outside of a dive bar called "Exquisite" (hence the neon sign). Maybe the creature will confront a foe, maybe it's waiting for a lover, maybe it's a loner loitering outside. In any case, there is an air of tension in the piece. Things could go awry at any moment.
      </p>

        final reflections
      </h1>
      <p>
        This project was enjoyable because it required taking drawings in very
        different styles and forms and consolidating them into something
        cohesive. I liked the freedom to play with color, stylize the very different drawings to become one being, and the creation of a scene / backstory.
