        In this project, we were prompted to create a digital camera. I chose to create a MOSSCAM, a camera that takes a subject and helps them to be more complimentary to moss. My intentions with this were to (1) somewhat conceal and erase the identity of a figure by making them look "mossy," so to speak, and (2) call attention to something that gets overlooked all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout CC and the semester as a whole, my projects have focused on being mindful of the self, of natural elements, and of how those two things interact. I liked the simplicity of a MOSSCAM - it quickly transforms a figure into a bed of moss, and takes the responsibility of moving, eating, speaking, etc. away from the figure for a moment.
      </p>

        I did not especially enjoy doing this project because it required a camera throughout the coding process. I already don't love taking pictures of myself, and I found it unsettling to be continuously on camera. I was uncomfortable with the fact that an uninterrupted surveillance tool was exactly the product of this project. Even with the filters, it is still an image of me that's captured. I didn't want to confront the ease at which an image can be captured.
