      <p>
        Draw two faces â€“ the first drawing should depict the face at its maximum
        scale, and the second drawing should depict the face at its minimum
        scale. Once you have an idea of how your face would look like at its
        maximum / minimum scale, you should be able to use the range in between
        to create variations of the form.

        design process
      </h1>

      <p>
        This project was a great venue for communicating emotion through scale
        and for augmenting the connection between viewer and image through
        direct interaction. Starting out with those two intentions, I began
        sketching my two faces.
      </p>

      <img class="full-width-box"
        src="https://cdn.glitch.com/c5129550-5815-48a4-a8a6-b37d3c069ff5%2FfaceGenerator.png?v=1631629466347"
        alt="Sketch of different sized faces"
      />

      <p>
        My initial inclination was to use the scale to communicate a sense of
        anger, then a sense of smallness. As I continued to develop my sketch,
        especially after playing around within the p5.js editor, I wanted the
        message of this sketch to be the enormity of the challenges facing
        humanity - more specifically, facing the youth of humanity - like
        climate change, racial inequity, and late stage capitalism. I wanted to
        comment on living this experience as a young person. Capture the pain,
        the complexity, and some of the tools to combat it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started with the world, a blue ocean background with some, but not all
        of the continents. I abstracted those elements to mirror the style of
        the generated face as well as to deemphasize the physical world in this
        sketch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, I constructed the face itself, a relatively simple design. I
        wanted the emphasis to be on the eyes, as well as the colors, which I
        randomized. I felt that the changing colors communicated a sense of
        anxiety and unrest.
      </p>
      <p>
        I randomized the height of the eye in
        order to practice p5.js, but it ended up being a happy accident. I liked
        that it made the eye look like it was blinking. It gave the sense of the
        passage of time, and it also communicated that the face was taking in a
        great deal of visual information from across the world.
      </p>
      <h1>
        final reflections
      </h1>
      <p>
        <i
          >Young people are cynical about love. Ultimately, cynicism is the
          great mask of the disappointed and betrayed heart. - bell hooks</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I did not want this sketch to come across as solely cynical. I wanted to
        communicate that there is still space for us to notice the small things.
        To do so, I included the option to press a key on the keyboard to both
        change the color and erase the noise from the sketch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the "click for days till redemption," and the randomly
        generated number have a double meaning. There is a cynical irony about
        that element, an apocalyptic proclamation, but there is also a
        hopefulness. Maybe redemption represents the day that we will save
        ourselves, when we will come together and create something that is built
        upon a common love, a common suffering, a common experience of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        While talking to Yi Wei (@yiiiiwei), friend and poet, we spoke of the
        need for hope in art. All of the writers, artists, and performers we
        admired most were able to convey the entirety of the human experience.
        We were both especially interested in how great artists can capture
        moments of intense joy, even in the face of so much suffering. We
        decided that there is something to be said about the artist's
        responsibility to notice, to slow down, and to amplify joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cynicism is necessary to acknowledge the challenges in front of us, but
        joy and hope enable us to actively overcome them.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hope is that I will be able to use p5.js, as well as other visual
        tools, to amplify joy, center the issues that pain us, and create
        valuable, accessible commentary.
