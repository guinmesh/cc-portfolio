      <p>
        In <i>Tactics and Poetics of Invisible Writing</i> by Amy Suo Wu, we learn about sousveillance. Sousveillance is a counter to surveillance, in which citizens monitor and challenge a higher power of authority. It is a reclamation of agency over data.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were challenged to create a sousveillance tool for this project. My main goal in this project was to expose the extent to which our technology watches us. I wanted to create visibility. When I first started working after undergraduate, I was made aware of how much information our devices capture. Personal data like latitude and longitude, city, time, etc. is captured in real time, and there is no clear indication that it's happening. We are also conditioned to find this data capture convenient; for example, your phone automatically changes to the correct time when you cross into a new time zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to make this lack of privacy visible, I wanted to create a sort of satire. I began to think of ways I could combine location data with something either desensitizing or overstimulating. Eventually, I landed on the idea of an interactive poster. Much like the eye-catching graphics found on Instagram, TikTok, and other social media platforms, it veils extraction with flashy visual elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use an API from the <a href="https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/nl">Rijksmuseum</a> in the Netherlands to generate the images in the background, and I use the <a href="https://www.weatherbit.io/">Weatherbit API</a> to generate a forecast based on location.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many paintings in the Rijksmuseum were created to show a specific way of life. Though somewhat dramatized, they are artifacts of their time, and communicate a specific experience. By using them as a distraction from our current time, and by covering them up with text, their meaning becomes perverted. As images, they become co-opted and adopted for hegemonic use - distract the public from the realities of the present.
      </p>
      <h2>
        reflections
      </h2>
      <p>
        I really enjoyed working on this project. I loved diving back into visual design in this project, and I thought that the narratives present in this project were especially interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are still a few things that I would like to improve upon, though. Though this project does critique mass surveillance, it does not necessarily provide a hopeful outlook for the future. In order to do that, I think it would be necessary to provide steps for change and reclaiming agency. I hope that this visibility is a good first step, though.
