      <p>
        The Lost & Found project seeks to expose spoken word and visual
        representation as powerful, but limited, tools. An object is
        communicated through words, a sketch is created with the use of
        JavaScript, and an image is reborn. The image created with the use of
        these tools is not reality. Rather, it is an illustration of memory, an
        object multiplied, reanimated, and imperfect through our collective
        remembering (<a
          href="https://parsonsdt.github.io/critical-computation-2021/assignment/1.html"
          target="_blank"
          >Critical Computation 2021</a
        >).
      </p>
      <p>
        We experience the external world through our five senses. These senses,
        in turn, take in our experiences and transcribe them into memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        By engaging verbally and visually with these memories, we can provide
        insight into both the physical objects that we experience, as well as
        expose truths about ourselves. By nature, our memory is biased with
        gaps, biases, and other inaccuracies because it reflects what's on the
        interior, a unique positionality within the world's greater context.
        When we choose to generate images from memory, we gain an inside look
        into how we process images within the greater context of our cultural,
        racial, gendered - ultimately coded - environment.

        lost object: two-bamboo mahjong tile
      </h3>
      <p>
        I paired up with Kingsley Qi from aarati akkapeddi's section of the CC
        Lab. We shared verbal descriptions of objects that we had lost in order
        to digitally sketch and recreate them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps these digital sketches will provide some solace to each of us by
        gifting us the likeness of our beloved physical objects. Below, find the
        description of Kingsley's lost object - hopefully, I can bring it back
        to life.

        <i
          >One of the very important things I lost was a mahjong tile called
          “two bamboos”. It is in a rectangular shape. On the front of this
          mahjong tile, there are two green bamboo arranged vertically with
          white background. On the back of this mahjong tile, it is all green.
          About the sides, the third attached to the bottom is green and the
          rest is white. <br /><br />- Kingsley Qi (Parsons MFA DT '23)</i

          >2D primitives</a

        in the p5.js library, testing, sketching, and coding in the p5 editor.
        It was necessary to re-familiarize oneself with the Cartesian plane so
        that 2D shapes could be mapped accordingly.

      <p>
        My partner provided me with a concise, clear description of his lost
        object. There are specific directives that I included, such as the green
        line that extends along the right side of the tile. This element helps
        imply that the back of the tile is green, and it was an extremely useful
        detail for Kingsley to include. This small detail conveys a great deal
        of information; it tells us how the object may look like from different
        angles, and it lets us imagine what it would look like in 3D reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        My partner included a strong description, which quickly gave me a clear
        picture of how <i>I</i> know this particular object. However, it lacked
        the detail necessary for me to recreate the image that is present in
        <i>Kingsley’s</i> memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Context is also important. I already had personal memories of mahjong
        tiles, which shaped the way I chose to interpret the object, even when
        provided a description from an external source. The bamboo mahjong tile
        represented by the above sketch is not the one Kingsley thinks of.
        Because I approached the image with prior assumptions about what a
        mahjong tile is, any gaps in communication between Kingsley and I were
        filled automatically by the existing picture that lives in my head.
      </p>

        Many folks have had no experience with the game of mahjong or its
        elements. For them, the images of mahjong (including both the sketch and
        the example of mahjong above) may be more abstract, since there is
        nothing to connect to a previous memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I was influenced by the other images and designs I
        meditate on. For example, in this project, I was incredibly inspired by
        <a href="http://japanesedesign.pl/2012/ikko-tanaka/" target="_blank"
          >Ikko Tanaka</a
        >, a Japanese print artist whose simple, geometric designs and lithe
        typography make for incredible 2D images.
      </p>
      <p>
        Limitations in technical skill also determine the final product. This
        image was depicted using what was possible with 2D primitives and my
        limited knowledge of code. The image is only as realistic or
        naturalistic as my current expertise allows, since I am the one who is
        wielding the tools. As my proficiency in JavaScript increases, the image
        will more closely resemble the image I conjure.
