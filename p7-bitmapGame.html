        My bitmap game surrounds plants, emotion, and mutual care. My main character exists in their apartment, walking around, reorganizing, and taking care of their plants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea for this game stemmed again from personal experience. I wanted this game to be in conversation with my <a href="p3-experimentalClock.html">experimental clock sketch</a>; it provides additional commentary on the passage of time, the loneliness and listlessness of pandemic life, and the expectation for continuous advancement in career, social status, etc., despite the massive crisis happening outside of our doors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The intention, however, was not for this game to be only cynical or critical. My hope is that this sketch can provide a model for what pause looks like, and what it can be to lean into uncomfortable emotions in your own home. In this sketch, I represent small acts that make a large impact. The viewer or player is transported into a world that provides the option for contemplation, and prioritizes small acts of care and maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was incredibly inspired by both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_NIZ0BJWW0">Dys4ia</a> (2012) by Anna Anthropy as well as an exhibit by Wong Ping I saw at the New Museum earlier this year, <a href="https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibitions/view/wong-ping-your-silent-neighbor">Your Silent Neighbor</a>. I wanted to embody the same saturation of experience, dramatic color, and narrative communication in my own project.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        As with previous projects, my storyboard was much more detailed than my final sketch. However, the sketch did include many of the elements I sought to show. The game shows the interior space and the windows (or portals!). It includes several plants, specific furniture, the figure, and a similar color scheme to my original intention.
      </p>

        reflections

      <p>
        Overall, I am very satisfied with the outcome of this project. Though there were certain elements I struggled with, I think that the final result represents a narrative and a set of emotions that I wanted to communicate. There were small things that I tweaked.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I changed the color of the text slightly to allow for WCAG 2.1 compliant text on the background. Ultimately, I decided to make the text color match the hair color, which makes an even more cohesive color scheme in this game. I was quite happy with that outcome. I also simplified both the initial drawings and the goals of the game to fit within the scope of this project. Though I was sad to cut the watering can, detail of the room, and other elements, like books, I would love to explore those elements in future iterations. Next time, I would also like to include more detail in the character / player.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though I am not especially familiar with online games, I find this medium to be a fascinating way to explore narrative building, the creation of atmosphere, and the idea of worth or 'XP.' I think that all of these themes translate well to other forms of work I am interested in, such as video production, installation, and graphic design.
