        To interact with this sketch, click "Allow," when your browser asks for permission to access the camera on your computer. After toggling the slider to "YES !" and clicking "ENTER" on your keyboard, you should be able to see yourself in the p5.js-generated sketch!

      <p>
        In the last project, we were asked to create an experimental camera; however, the sketch generated was not created with consent from whoever shows up in the image. Even though the browser asks for a user's permission to access the camera, it gives limited information as to how that image will be generated, used, or saved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was meant to be a supplement to the earlier iteration of the experimental camera, so we had to take our existing sketch and ensure that it was more consentful. We did so according to the guidelines in the F.R.I.E.S model from <a href="the F.R.I.E.S model from Consentful Tech Zine">Consentful Tech Zine</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I included a written blurb to explain that viewers must give their consent prior to opening the camera, as well as an interactive element. Hopefully this implements enough checkpoints to allow viewers to make their own decisions about giving their face to the internet.
